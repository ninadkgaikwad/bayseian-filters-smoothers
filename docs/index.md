# bayesian-filters-smoothers
A unified library for Bayesian filter and smoother algorithms based on the book "Bayesian Filtering and Smoothing" - Simo Sarkka

#### Purpose of the Package
+ To provide a collection of all the Bayesian Filters and Smoothers in a unified framework
+ To be a building block for Bayesian Inference of state-space models
+ To provide building blocks for state estimation algorithms
+ To provide building blocks for parameter estimation algorithms


### Features
